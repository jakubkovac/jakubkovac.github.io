      <description>If you are reading this, you are probably future me. If you’re not, feel free to stay anyway, but this blog serves mostly as a reference for things I’m currently working at. Well, not really. If I’m writing this I have probably spent a lot of time either thinking about it, or actually doing all the work before writing this up.</description>
